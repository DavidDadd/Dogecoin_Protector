# FAQ
**Q1:** Why is it detected as a **virus** by my computer?

**A1:** It's not uncommon for compiled executables, especially those from independent developers, to be mistakenly flagged as potential threats by antivirus software â€“ this is known as a "false positive." Our software undergoes thorough testing and is designed with user safety in mind. However, antivirus programs can be overly cautious, especially with newly released or less recognized software. Your trust is invaluable to us, and we are committed to supporting you through any concerns or questions you may have. You can run the application in a virtual machine. Use different antivirus tools to check the software, which can help confirm it is a false positive.


**Q2:** Why don't you **open source** your application?

**A2:** We truly appreciate the spirit of the open-source community and the value it brings to the world of software. The decision to keep this application proprietary is rooted in the need to support its continuous development and maintenance. Creating and updating software requires a substantial investment of time, resources, and expertise. By offering the application as a paid product, we ensure that there is a stable foundation to provide ongoing support, implement new features, and keep the software up to date with the latest security standards.


**Q3:** Does the application engage in covert cryptocurrency mining, such as Monero, during the pin retrieval process?

**A3:** Absolutely not. The application only utilizes an internet connection for the purpose of verifying donations. Once activated, it operates entirely offline, ensuring that all functionalities are performed locally on your device without any hidden processes.
