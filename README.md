# FAQ
**Q1:** Why is it detected as a **virus** by my computer?

**A1:** It's not uncommon for compiled executables, especially those from independent developers, to be mistakenly flagged as potential threats by antivirus software – this is known as a "false positive." Our software undergoes thorough testing and is designed with user safety in mind. However, antivirus programs can be overly cautious, especially with newly released or less recognized software. Your trust is invaluable to us, and we are committed to supporting you through any concerns or questions you may have. You can run the application in a virtual machine. Use different antivirus tools to check the software, which can help confirm it is a false positive.


**Q2:** Why don't you **open source** your application?

**A2:** We truly appreciate the spirit of the open-source community and the value it brings to the world of software. The decision to keep this application proprietary is rooted in the need to support its continuous development and maintenance. Creating and updating software requires a substantial investment of time, resources, and expertise. By offering the application as a paid product, we ensure that there is a stable foundation to provide ongoing support, implement new features, and keep the software up to date with the latest security standards.


**Q3:** Does the application engage in covert cryptocurrency mining, such as Monero, during the pin retrieval process?

**A3:** Absolutely not. The application only utilizes an internet connection for the purpose of verifying donations. Once activated, it operates entirely offline, ensuring that all functionalities are performed locally on your device. 

**Q4:** Does the application steal my cryptocurrency?

**A4:** Certainly not. The application is designed with your security in mind; it does not have the capability to access your pin code or the seed phrase of your cold wallet. Its function is solely to generate and retrieve a random pin/passphrase, giving you complete discretion to alter it as you see fit. 

**Q5:** What are the consequences of deleting the chain.txt file created by the application?

**A5:** Deleting the chain.txt file, if you have already configured your pin(s) based on the application-generated pin(s), means that you will lose the ability to retrieve your pin(s). The most advisable course of action would be to attempt to restore the chain.txt file or, if necessary, reset your cold wallet using your seed phrase. Please exercise extreme caution when managing the chain.txt file. Modifying chain.txt file may corrupt the file and result in searching failure.

**Q6:** Where can I see the found Pin(s)/Passphrase?

**A6:** In the result.txt file

**Q7:** What should I do after I have found all the pins?

**A7:** You can delete chain.txt and result.txt files and generate a new chain.txt file after you are sure that the files are no use to you anymore.

**Q8:** 所以说你这软件到底是干什么用的?/So, what exactly is the purpose of this software?

**A8:** 不管是在加密市场还是股票市场，投资者总是被市场的价格波动和各种消息而影响着从而做出不理智的决定。在投资者发现了一个有长期上涨潜力的加密货币后，这个软件可以帮助加密货币投资者"管住手"，通过pin码或passphrase强制性地锁住钱包从而防止投资者做出非理智的决定。该程序可以防止用户开高风险的杠杆，防止用户将BTC/ETH/DOGE转换为Pump＆Dump Shit Coin / Tokens，防止用户被社会工程攻击所欺骗。/Whether in the cryptocurrency market or the stock market, investors are always influenced by market price fluctuations and various news, leading them to make irrational decisions. After investors have identified a cryptocurrency with long-term growth potential, this software can help cryptocurrency investors 'HODL' by forcibly locking the wallet with a PIN code or passphrase, thus preventing investors from making irrational decisions. This program can prevent users from opening high-risk leverage, prevent users from converting BTC/ETH/DOGE into Pump & Dump Shit Coin/Tokens, and protect users from being deceived by social engineering attacks.

**Q9:** What does AI think about the software?

**A9:** ChatGPT:The concept described in the text reflects an interesting approach to managing the emotional and psychological aspects of investing, particularly in volatile markets like cryptocurrencies and stocks. Here are a few thoughts on this idea:
1. **Emotional Investing**: The software addresses a common problem in investing: emotional decision-making. Investors often react impulsively to market fluctuations or news, leading to potentially unwise decisions. A tool that helps to moderate these impulses could be beneficial.
2. **Forced Discipline**: By using a PIN or passphrase to lock the wallet, the software imposes a forced discipline on the investor. This could help investors stick to their long-term investment strategies, avoiding short-term reactions to market movements.
3. **Potential Limitations**: While this approach could prevent impulsive decisions, it might also restrict the ability to react quickly to legitimate market changes. For example, in a rapidly declining market or in the face of emerging negative news about a specific cryptocurrency, the inability to access funds quickly could be a disadvantage.
4. **Investor Education and Mindset**: This tool might be more effective if paired with investor education. Understanding market dynamics, investment strategies, and risk management can also help investors make more informed decisions, reducing the reliance on a forced lock mechanism.
5. **Security Concerns**: The security of the locking mechanism would be crucial. If the PIN or passphrase security is compromised, it could pose a risk to the investor's funds.
6. **Psychological Impact**: There's also a psychological aspect to consider. The feeling of being 'locked out' of one's own assets could be frustrating for some investors, especially if they believe a market opportunity is being missed.
Overall, it's an innovative idea that addresses a real challenge in investment behavior. However, its effectiveness would likely depend on the individual investor's temperament, investment strategy, and the security and usability of the software.
